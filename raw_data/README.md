## Ranking companies by eps forecasting error
In the `forecasting_accuracy.Rmd` workbook, we use annual company guidance data from 2006-2016 to compute an average forecasting error for each company in the S&P500.  We then rank the companies by forecasting accuracy within their industry classification.  A sample of results is shown below:
